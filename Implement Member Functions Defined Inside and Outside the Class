Aim
To write a program that demonstrates defining member functions inside a class and outside a class in Object-Oriented Programming.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Create a class with data members.
Define one member function inside the class.
Declare another member function inside the class but define it outside using scope resolution.
Create objects of the class.
Call both types of member functions using the object.
Display the output.
End the program.

Program (Python Equivalent Demonstration)
(Python does not use scope resolution like C++, but the concept is demonstrated using inside and outside class definitions.)
# Program to illustrate member functions defined inside and outside the class

class Student:
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Member function defined inside the class
    def show_name(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)

    # Declaring method that will be defined outside the class
    def show_age(self):
        pass


# Defining member function outside the class
def show_age_outside(self):
    print("Age:", self.age)

# Assigning the outside function to the class
Student.show_age = show_age_outside


# Creating an object
s = Student("Alice", 18)

# Calling member functions
s.show_name()   # Function defined inside class
s.show_age()    # Function defined outside class

Output (Result)
Name: Alice
Age: 18

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates member functions that are defined inside the class and defined outside the class.
