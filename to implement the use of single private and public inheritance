Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of single inheritance using both
public inheritance and
private inheritance.

public
Algorithm
Start the program.
Create a base class with data members and member functions.
Create a derived class that inherits the base class publicly.
Public members of base class remain public in derived class.
Create an object of derived class and access inherited members.
Display the output.
End.

Program (Public Inheritance)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void showBase() {
        cout << "This is Base Class (Public Member)." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {   // public inheritance
public:
    void showDerived() {
        cout << "This is Derived Class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;

    cout << "Public Inheritance Output:" << endl;
    obj.showBase();      // Accessible because of public inheritance
    obj.showDerived();

    return 0;
}

Output (Public Inheritance)
Public Inheritance Output:
This is Base Class (Public Member).
This is Derived Class.

private
Algorithm
Create the same base class.
Create another derived class that inherits the base class privately.
Public members of base become private in the derived class.
They can be accessed inside derived class but not through the object.
Display output using derived class methods.
End.

Program (Private Inheritance)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base2 {
public:
    void baseFunction() {
        cout << "This is Base Class Function." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived2 : private Base2 {   // private inheritance
public:
    void accessBase() {
        baseFunction();   // Allowed (inside derived class)
        cout << "Accessed Base Function through Private Inheritance." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived2 obj;

    cout << "\nPrivate Inheritance Output:" << endl;
    obj.accessBase();   // Works because it calls the base function internally

    return 0;
}

Output (Private Inheritance)
Private Inheritance Output:
This is Base Class Function.
Accessed Base Function through Private Inheritance.

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates:
Single Public Inheritance:
Public members of base class remain public in derived class.
Accessible through derived class object.
Single Private Inheritance:
Public members of base class become private in derived class.
Accessible only within derived class, not through object.
