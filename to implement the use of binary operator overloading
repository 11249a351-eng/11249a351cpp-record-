Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates binary operator overloading using a class.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Create a class with data members.
Define a constructor to initialize the objects.
Overload a binary operator (such as +, -, or *) using a member function.
In the operator function, take another object as an argument and perform the operation.
Return the resulting object.
Create objects in the main() function.
Apply the binary operator between the objects.
Display the results.
End the program.

Program (C++)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Number {
    int x;

public:
    // Constructor
    Number(int a = 0) {
        x = a;
    }

    // Binary operator overloading for +
    Number operator+(Number obj) {
        Number temp;
        temp.x = x + obj.x;   // add values of both objects
        return temp;
    }

    // Display function
    void display() {
        cout << "Value: " << x << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Number n1(20), n2(30), n3;

    cout << "Object 1: ";
    n1.display();

    cout << "Object 2: ";
    n2.display();

    // Using overloaded + operator
    n3 = n1 + n2;

    cout << "\nResult After Applying + Operator:" << endl;
    n3.display();

    return 0;
}

Sample Output (Result)
Object 1: Value: 20
Object 2: Value: 30
Result After Applying + Operator:
Value: 50

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates the use of binary operator overloading in C++, where a binary operator (+) is overloaded to operate on objects.
