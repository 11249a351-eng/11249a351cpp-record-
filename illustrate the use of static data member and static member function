Aim
To write a program that demonstrates the use of static data members and static member functions in C++.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Create a class with a static data member and a normal data member.
Define a static member function to access or modify the static data member.
Create objects of the class.
Access the static data member through:
the class name
the static member function
Access the normal data member using objects.
Display the results.
End the program.

Program (C++)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    int roll;                    // normal data member
    static int count;            // static data member

public:
    // Constructor
    Student(int r) {
        roll = r;
        count++;                 // increment static variable
    }

    // Static member function
    static void displayCount() {
        cout << "Total Students: " << count << endl;
    }

    // Function to display roll number
    void display() {
        cout << "Roll Number: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

// Definition of static data member
int Student::count = 0;

int main() {
    Student s1(101);
    Student s2(102);
    Student s3(103);

    cout << "Displaying Individual Students:" << endl;
    s1.display();
    s2.display();
    s3.display();

    cout << "\nCalling Static Member Function:" << endl;
    Student::displayCount();   // calling static function using class name

    return 0;
}

Output (Result)
Displaying Individual Students:
Roll Number: 101
Roll Number: 102
Roll Number: 103

Calling Static Member Function:
Total Students: 3

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates the concept of:
Static Data Member (shared by all objects)
Static Member Function (can be called using the class name without creating an object)
