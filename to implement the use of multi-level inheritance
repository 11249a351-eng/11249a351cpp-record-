Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates multilevel inheritance, where a derived class inherits from another derived class, forming a multi-step inheritance chain.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Create a base class with a member function.
Create a second class that inherits publicly from the base class.
Create a third class that inherits publicly from the second derived class (multilevel).
Define member functions in each class to show their identity.
In the main() function, create an object of the last derived class.
Call functions from all classes to show inheritance flow.
Display the output.
End the program.

Program (C++)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// Base class
class A {
public:
    void showA() {
        cout << "This is Class A (Base Class)." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived from A
class B : public A {
public:
    void showB() {
        cout << "This is Class B (Derived from A)." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived from B (Multilevel inheritance)
class C : public B {
public:
    void showC() {
        cout << "This is Class C (Derived from B)." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    C obj;

    cout << "Multilevel Inheritance Output:" << endl;
    obj.showA();   // From class A
    obj.showB();   // From class B
    obj.showC();   // From class C

    return 0;
}

Sample Output (Result)
Multilevel Inheritance Output:
This is Class A (Base Class).
This is Class B (Derived from A).
This is Class C (Derived from B).

Result
The program successfully demonstrates multilevel inheritance, where:
Class B inherits from Class A
Class C inherits from Class B
Thus forming an inheritance chain A → B → C.
