Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates signal handling using the signal() function and signal handler routines.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Include the <csignal> and <iostream> headers.
Define a signal handler function.
Register the signal handler using signal(signal_number, handler).
Run an infinite loop (or wait for user action) to keep program active.
When the user presses Ctrl + C, the signal handler is invoked.
Display message inside signal handler.
Terminate the program gracefully.

Program (C++ – Signal Handling using SIGINT)
#include <iostream>
#include <csignal>
#include <unistd.h>
using namespace std;

void signalHandler(int signum) {
    cout << "\nInterrupt Signal (" << signum << ") received.\n";
    cout << "Exiting program safely...\n";
    exit(signum);
}

int main() {
    // Register signal handler
    signal(SIGINT, signalHandler);

    cout << "Program running..." << endl;
    cout << "Press Ctrl + C to trigger signal (SIGINT)." << endl;

    while (1) {
        cout << "Working..." << endl;
        sleep(1);   // slow down loop
    }

    return 0;
}

Sample Output (Result)
Program Output Before Signal
Program running...
Press Ctrl + C to trigger signal (SIGINT).
Working...
Working...
Working...

When User Presses Ctrl + C
^C
Interrupt Signal (2) received.
Exiting program safely...

Result
The program successfully demonstrates signal handling in C++ using:
signal() function
User-defined signal handler
Handling asynchronous events such as Ctrl + C (SIGINT)
The program terminates gracefully when a signal is received.
