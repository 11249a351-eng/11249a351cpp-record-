Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of multiple inheritance where a derived class inherits from two base classes.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Create two base classes, each with its own data members and member functions.
Create a derived class that inherits publicly from both base classes.
In the derived class, define a member function that uses members of both base classes.
Create an object of the derived class.
Call functions from the base classes using the derived class object.
Display the combined output.
End the program.

Program (C++)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// First base class
class A {
public:
    void showA() {
        cout << "This is Class A." << endl;
    }
};

// Second base class
class B {
public:
    void showB() {
        cout << "This is Class B." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class inheriting from both A and B
class C : public A, public B {
public:
    void showC() {
        cout << "This is Derived Class C (Multiple Inheritance)." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    C obj;

    cout << "Multiple Inheritance Output:" << endl;
    obj.showA();   // From class A
    obj.showB();   // From class B
    obj.showC();   // From class C

    return 0;
}

Sample Output (Result)
Multiple Inheritance Output:
This is Class A.
This is Class B.
This is Derived Class C (Multiple Inheritance).

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates multiple inheritance, where a derived class inherits features from two base classes.
