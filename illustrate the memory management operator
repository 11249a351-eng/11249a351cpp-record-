Aim
To write a C++ program that illustrates the use of memory management operators new and delete for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Declare a pointer variable.
Use the new operator to dynamically allocate memory for:
a single variable
an array
Store values in the dynamically allocated memory.
Display the values.
Use the delete operator to free memory allocated for a single variable.
Use the delete[] operator to free the memory allocated for the array.
End the program.

Program (C++)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Dynamic allocation of a single integer
    int *p = new int;
    *p = 50;

    cout << "Value stored in dynamically allocated variable: " << *p << endl;

    // Dynamic allocation of an array
    int *arr = new int[3];
    arr[0] = 10;
    arr[1] = 20;
    arr[2] = 30;

    cout << "Values stored in dynamically allocated array:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Deallocating memory
    delete p;        // frees single variable
    delete[] arr;    // frees array memory

    cout << "Memory successfully deallocated." << endl;

    return 0;
}

Sample Output (Result)
Value stored in dynamically allocated variable: 50
Values stored in dynamically allocated array:
10 20 30 
Memory successfully deallocated.

Result
Thus, the program demonstrates the use of new and delete operators for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C++.
