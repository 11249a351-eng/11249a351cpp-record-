Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of the
this pointer to refer to the current object
inline functions for faster function execution.

Part 1 — Demonstration of this Pointer
Algorithm

Start the program.
Define a class with data members.
Use a parameterized constructor or a setter function where local variables have the same name as data members.
Use the this pointer to distinguish between data members and function parameters.
Create an object and display the values.
End the program.

Program (Using this Pointer)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Student {
    int roll;
    string name;

public:
    Student(int roll, string name) {
        this->roll = roll;      // using this pointer
        this->name = name;      // using this pointer
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Roll Number: " << roll << endl;
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1(101, "Rahul");

    cout << "Using this Pointer:" << endl;
    s1.display();

    return 0;
}

Output
Using this Pointer:
Roll Number: 101
Name: Rahul

Part 2 — Demonstration of Inline Function
Algorithm
Start the program.
Declare an inline function for simple operations such as addition or multiplication.
Call the inline function inside main().
Display the result.
End the program.

Program (Inline Function)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
inline int add(int a, int b) {    // inline function
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 20;

    cout << "\nUsing Inline Function:" << endl;
    cout << "Sum = " << add(x, y) << endl;

    return 0;
}

Output
Using Inline Function:
Sum = 30

Result
The program successfully demonstrates:
Use of this pointer
Helps to refer to the current object's data members.
Resolves naming conflicts between parameters and member variables.
Use of inline function
Allows small functions to execute faster.
Avoids function call overhead.
