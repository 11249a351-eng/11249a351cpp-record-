Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates file handling, including writing data to a file and reading data from a file using fstream, ofstream, and ifstream classes.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Include the <fstream> header for file operations.
Declare an ofstream object and open a text file.
Write data into the file.
Close the file.
Declare an ifstream object and open the same file.
Read and display the contents of the file.
Close the file.
End the program.

Program (C++ – File Handling Example)
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Writing to a file
    ofstream fout("record.txt");  // open file for writing
    if (!fout) {
        cout << "File cannot be created!" << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    fout << "Hello, this is a file handling example." << endl;
    fout << "C++ makes reading and writing files easy.";
    fout.close();

    // Reading from a file
    ifstream fin("record.txt");   // open file for reading
    if (!fin) {
        cout << "File cannot be opened!" << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    cout << "Reading from file:" << endl;
    string line;
    while (getline(fin, line)) {
        cout << line << endl;
    }

    fin.close();
    return 0;
}

Sample Output (Result)
Reading from file:
Hello, this is a file handling example.
C++ makes reading and writing files easy.
A file named record.txt is created, containing the same text.

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates file handling operations, including:
Creating a file
Writing data to a file
Reading data from a file
Using ofstream and ifstream
