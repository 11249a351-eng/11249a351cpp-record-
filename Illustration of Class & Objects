Aim
To write a program that illustrates the concept of class and objects in Object-Oriented Programming.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Define a class with data members (attributes).
Create a constructor to initialize the data members.
Define a method to display the attribute values.
Create objects (instances) of the class.
Using the objects, access the methods of the class.
Display the results.
End the program.

Program (Python)
# Program to illustrate Class and Objects

class Student:
    # Constructor to initialize object
    def __init__(self, name, roll, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.roll = roll
        self.marks = marks

    # Method to display data
    def display(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)
        print("Roll Number:", self.roll)
        print("Marks:", self.marks)


# Creating objects of the Student class
s1 = Student("Alice", 101, 89)
s2 = Student("Bob", 102, 92)

print("Details of Student 1:")
s1.display()

print("\nDetails of Student 2:")
s2.display()

Output (Result)
Details of Student 1:
Name: Alice
Roll Number: 101
Marks: 89

Details of Student 2:
Name: Bob
Roll Number: 102
Marks: 92

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates the concept of class and objects in OOP.
