Aim
To write a C++ program that demonstrates exception handling using try, throw, and catch blocks.

Algorithm
Start the program.
Accept numerator and denominator from the user.
In a try block, check whether denominator is zero.
If denominator is zero, throw an exception.
Catch the exception using a catch block and display an error message.
If no exception occurs, perform division and display the result.
End the program.

Program (C++ – Exception Handling Example)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int num, den;

    cout << "Enter Numerator: ";
    cin >> num;
    cout << "Enter Denominator: ";
    cin >> den;

    try {
        if (den == 0) {
            throw den;  // throwing exception
        }
        cout << "Result = " << (num / den) << endl;
    }
    catch (int) {
        cout << "Exception Caught: Division by Zero is Not Allowed!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Sample Output (Result)
Case 1: Valid Input
Enter Numerator: 20
Enter Denominator: 4
Result = 5

Case 2: Division by Zero
Enter Numerator: 20
Enter Denominator: 0
Exception Caught: Division by Zero is Not Allowed!

Result
Thus, the program successfully demonstrates the concept of exception handling in C++, using try, throw, and catch to manage runtime errors safely.
